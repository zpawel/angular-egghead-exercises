* ***mask*** directive restricted as element and with given template as follows: 

*```<img src="assets/mask.png" class="mask-position" width="62px">```*

* ***superhero*** directive restricted as element with template that use previous directives  - you should put mask after the hero element (use directives inside template 

*```<div class="relative-position">....</div>```* 

* Directives used in correct places at **index.html** (check comments)

The **superhero** should look as follows:
